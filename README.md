# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, zsh, tmux, optimized for ArchLinux + MacOs. Managed with [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

## Terminal

I use [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell

- Neovim on its [lastet release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master)


- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) +
  [oh my tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) to manage sessions

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use Git
